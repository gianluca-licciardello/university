{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"aUpniP_IFgd9"},"source":["CoNLL-2003 dataset task demonstrates the labeling of tokens for named entity recognition (NER), part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and chunking. Each component of the JSON object corresponds to a different layer of annotation for the sentence:\n","\n","1. **Tokens**: These are the individual words or punctuation marks from the text. In this case, the sentence \"EU rejects German call to boycott British lamb.\" is split into tokens:\n","   - \"EU\"\n","   - \"rejects\"\n","   - \"German\"\n","   - \"call\"\n","   - \"to\"\n","   - \"boycott\"\n","   - \"British\"\n","   - \"lamb\"\n","   - \".\"\n","\n","2. **POS Tags**: This array contains the POS tags corresponding to each token. The tags are encoded as numbers, each representing a specific part of speech (like noun, verb, adjective). These numbers usually correspond to a tagging scheme such as the Penn Treebank POS tags:\n","   - \"EU\" is tagged as 22, which represents a proper noun.\n","   - \"rejects\" is tagged as 42, indicating a verb in present tense.\n","   - And so forth.\n","\n","3. **Chunk Tags**: This array indicates phrase chunk boundaries and types (like NP for noun phrase, VP for verb phrase). Each number again corresponds to a specific type of phrase or boundary in a predefined scheme:\n","   - \"EU\" is part of a noun phrase, hence 11.\n","   - \"rejects\" begins a verb phrase, indicated by 21.\n","   - The chunk tags help in parsing the sentence into linguistically meaningful phrases.\n","\n","4. **NER Tags**: These tags are used for named entity recognition. They identify whether each token is part of a named entity (like a person, location, organization) and the type of entity:\n","   - \"EU\" is tagged as 3, denoting an organization.\n","   - \"German\" and \"British\" are tagged as 7, indicating nationality or ethnicity.\n","   - Other tokens are tagged as 0, meaning they are not recognized as part of any named entity."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"lr7rTDQnFgeG"},"outputs":[],"source":["#!pip install uv\n","#!uv pip install numpy pandas torch transformers datasets
